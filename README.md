Chainviz visualizes the following aspects of the Kusama relay chain and validators in real-time:

-   Active Validators, and the block production and finalization process.
-   Network stats.
    -   Best and finalized blocks.
    -   Era staking data.
-   Active validator list and their activity.
-   Paravalidators, and the assignment of paravalidators to parachains.
-   Validator details panel, where the user can watch the validator in real-time.

Chainviz uses the services provided by the [SubVT backend](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend), part of SubVT, a project supported by the Kusama Treasury.

ðŸš§ Chainviz is in heavy progress, and this repo is subject to frequent change.
